Pong
====

Here is the source code for my own implementation of the classic arcade game 'Pong'. It is written in C++ and uses the SFML 1.6 API.

Requirements
-------------------
* SFML 1.6 -- This project does NOT include the SFML 1.6 library. In a future release, I plan on including everything needed to compile the code and a make file. For now, please consult the [documentation](http://sfml-dev.org/tutorials/1.6/) to find out how to setup SFML 1.6 with your IDE of choice.
