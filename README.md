Pong
====
Here is the source code for my own implementation of the classic arcade game 'Pong'. It is written in C++ and uses the SFML 1.6 API.

Background
-----------------
This project was a way for me to learn the very basics of game programming and engine design. I decided to share the source code online for those who wish to get started with game programming yet would like an example project to learn from. Additionally, I hope that those more experienced than me would look at my code and apply any fixes or offer suggestions.

Requirements
-------------------
* SFML 1.6 -- This project does NOT include the SFML 1.6 library. In a future release, I plan on including everything needed to compile the code and a make file. For now, please consult the [documentation](http://sfml-dev.org/tutorials/1.6/) to find out how to setup SFML 1.6 with your IDE of choice.

Usage
---------
The included resource files (PressStart2P.ttf, paddleHit.wav, wallHit.wav) must be in the same folder as your executable for the program to work correctly.

To Do
--------
* Add sound effects and music
* Code clean-up and organization

License
--------
There is no licence! Use this code however you wish.
